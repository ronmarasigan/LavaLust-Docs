Model–View–Controller
=====================

LavaLust is based on the **Model–View–Controller (MVC)** development pattern.  
MVC is a software approach that separates **application logic** from **presentation**.  

In practice, this allows your web pages to contain minimal scripting since the presentation is kept separate from the PHP logic.

**Model**
---------

The **Model** represents your data structures.  
Typically, your model classes contain functions that help you **retrieve, insert, and update** information in your database.

**View**
--------

The **View** is the information presented to the user.  
A view is normally a full web page, but in LavaLust it can also be a **page fragment** (like a header or footer), an **RSS feed**, or any other type of “page.”

**Controller**
--------------

The **Controller** acts as an intermediary between the **Model**, the **View**, and other resources needed to process the HTTP request and generate a response.
