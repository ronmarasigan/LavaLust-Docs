LavaLust at a Glance
====================
    
Free, Fast, and Lightweight
---------------------------

LavaLust is an application framework written in PHP that was designed for faster project development.  
It has built-in libraries and helpers that minimize the amount of time needed to code common tasks.  
LavaLust is also **open-source** under the MIT license. Unlike other frameworks, LavaLust is very **lightweight** and **fast**.

Model–View–Controller
----------------------

The **Model–View–Controller (MVC)** is an architectural pattern that separates an application into three main logical components:  
the **model**, the **view**, and the **controller**. Each of these components is built to handle specific development aspects of an application.  
MVC is one of the most frequently used industry-standard web development frameworks to create scalable and extensible projects.

Generates Clean URLs
---------------------

The URLs generated by LavaLust are clean and search-engine friendly.  
Rather than using the standard “query string” approach to URLs that is common in dynamic systems,  
LavaLust uses a **segment-based** approach:

::

   example.com/news/article/345

.. note::

   By default, the ``index.php`` file is included in the URL, but it can be removed using a simple ``.htaccess`` file.
