Application Flow Chart
======================

The following graphic illustrates how data flows throughout the LavaLust system:

**Process Overview**

1. The ``index.php`` serves as the **front controller**, initializing the base resources needed to run LavaLust.
2. The **Router** examines the HTTP request to determine what should be done with it.
3. If a **cache file exists**, it is sent directly to the browser, bypassing the normal system execution.
4. **Security**: Before the application controller is loaded, the HTTP request and any user-submitted data are filtered for security.
5. The **Controller** loads the **model**, core **libraries**, **helpers**, and any other resources needed to process the specific request.
6. The finalized **View** is rendered and sent to the web browser to be seen.  
   If caching is enabled, the view is cached first so that on subsequent requests it can be served directly.
