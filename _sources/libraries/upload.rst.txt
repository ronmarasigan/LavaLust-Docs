Upload Class
============

The **Upload** class allows you to **upload files** safely in LavaLust.  
You can define various preferences, such as allowed file types, size restrictions, and automatic filename encryption.

The Process
------------

Uploading a file involves the following general process:

1. An upload form is displayed, allowing the user to select a file.
2. When the form is submitted, the file is uploaded to the destination directory.
3. The file is validated based on the preferences you set.
4. On success, a confirmation is displayed. Otherwise, errors are shown.

Creating the Upload Form
-------------------------

Create a view file called ``upload_form.php`` inside your ``app/views/`` directory:

.. code-block:: php

   <html>
   <head>
      <title>Upload Form</title>
   </head>
   <body>

   <?php foreach($errors as $error) { echo $error; } ?>

   <form action="<?php echo site_url('upload/do_upload');?>" method="post" enctype="multipart/form-data">
      <input type="file" name="userfile" size="20" />
      <br><br>
      <input type="submit" value="upload" />
   </form>

   </body>
   </html>

The Success Page
-----------------

Create another view file called ``upload_success.php`` in the same folder:

.. code-block:: php

   <html>
   <head>
      <title>Upload Success</title>
   </head>
   <body>

   <h3>Your file was successfully uploaded!</h3>

   <?php echo $filename; ?>

   </body>
   </html>

The Controller
---------------

Create a controller called ``UploadController.php`` inside your ``app/controllers/`` directory:

.. code-block:: php

   <?php
   class UploadController extends Controller {

      public function upload() {
         $this->call->library('upload', $_FILES["userfile"]);

         $this->upload
            ->max_size(5)
            ->min_size(1)
            ->set_dir('public')
            ->allowed_extensions(['jpg'])
            ->allowed_mimes(['image/jpeg'])
            ->is_image()
            ->encrypt_name();

         if ($this->upload->do_upload()) {
            $data['filename'] = $this->upload->get_filename();
            $this->call->view('upload_success', $data);
         } else {
            $data['errors'] = $this->upload->get_errors();
            $this->call->view('upload_form', $data);
         }
      }
   }

The Upload Directory
---------------------

You will need a destination directory for your uploaded files.  
Create a directory called ``uploads`` in the root of your LavaLust installation and set its permissions to **777**.

Initialization
---------------

Like most other classes in LavaLust, the Upload class is initialized in your controller using:

.. code-block:: php

   <?php
   $this->call->library('upload');

Once the Upload class is loaded, you can access it via:

.. code-block:: php

   <?php
   $this->upload;

Setting Preferences
--------------------

You control what is allowed to be uploaded through various preference methods.  
Example:

.. code-block:: php

   <?php
   $this->call->library('upload', $_FILES["userfile"]);
   $this->upload
      ->max_size(5)
      ->min_size(1)
      ->set_dir('public')
      ->allowed_extensions(['jpg'])
      ->allowed_mimes(['image/jpeg'])
      ->is_image()
      ->encrypt_name();
