Email Class
===========

The Email class makes sending email **simple and easy**.  
It uses PHP’s built-in ``mail()`` function under the hood.  

If you are planning to use more advanced features (SMTP, authentication, HTML templates, etc.),  
you may integrate third-party libraries such as **PHPMailer** instead.

Basic Usage
------------

Here is a basic example demonstrating how you might send email.  
**Note:** This example assumes you are sending the email from one of your controllers.

.. code-block:: php

   <?php
   $this->call->library('email');

   $this->email->sender('your@example.com', 'Your Name');
   $this->email->recipient('someone@example.com');

   $this->email->subject('Email Test');
   $this->email->email_content('Testing the email class.');

   $this->email->send();

     - **$content** *(required)* — Content of the email  
       **$email_type** *(optional)* — Defaults to ``plain``. Use ``html`` for HTML content
   * - ``attachment($path)``
     - **$path** *(required)* — Path where your attachment file is located
   * - ``send()``
     - Sends the composed email. Must be called last to actually send the email.

.. note::

   You must call ``$this->email->send()`` at the end to actually send the email.  
   All other methods just prepare the email before sending.
