before_action Hook
==================

.. method:: before_action() -> void

    The **before_action hook** is automatically executed before any controller
    action method. It provides a central place to run logic that should occur
    prior to each controller method, such as:

    - Authentication checks
    - Authorization validation
    - Input preprocessing
    - Logging or debugging initialization

    By default, this hook is empty. Extend or override it in your controller
    classes to implement custom pre-action behavior.

    :return void: This hook does not return a value.

Example
-------

Override the hook in a controller to perform authentication:

.. code-block:: php

    class PostController extends BaseController
    {
        public function before_action()
        {
            // Ensure user is logged in before any action
            if (!$this->auth->check()) {
                redirect('login');
            }
        }

        public function index()
        {
            // Runs only after before_action hook passes
            $posts = $this->postModel->all();
            $this->load->view('posts/index', ['posts' => $posts]);
        }
    }
