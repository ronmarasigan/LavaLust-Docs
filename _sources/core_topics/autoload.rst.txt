Auto-loading Resources
=======================

Frameworks like CodeIgniter and LavaLust support an **auto-load** feature that automatically initializes certain resources every time the system runs. This is especially useful for resources that are used globally across the application.

Resources That Can Be Auto-loaded
---------------------------------

The following items can be loaded automatically:

- **Libraries**: Classes located in the `libraries/` directory.
- **Helpers**: Files located in the `helpers/` directory.
- **Config files**: Custom configuration files in the `config/` directory.
- **Models**: Files located in the `models/` directory.

Configuring Auto-loading
------------------------

To enable auto-loading:

1. Open the file: ``app/config/autoload.php``.
2. Add the resources you want to auto-load to the corresponding array for each type of resource.
3. Do **not** include the file extension (e.g., ``.php``) when specifying items in the array.

For example, in ``autoload.php``:

.. code-block:: php

    $autoload['libraries'] = ['database', 'session'];
    $autoload['helper'] = ['url', 'form'];
    $autoload['model'] = ['BlogModel'];

Composer Auto-loading
----------------------

If your project uses Composer, you can enable Composer's auto-loader:

1. Open ``app/config/config.php``.
2. Set the configuration variable ``$config['composer_autoload']`` to:

   - ``TRUE`` to use the default Composer auto-loader.
   - A custom path to your Composer ``vendor/autoload.php`` if needed.

Note
----

- Auto-loading should be used sparingly for resources that are required globally.
- Overloading unnecessary resources can slow down application performance.
